1. This is my machine learning's lab01. 
2. final_house_load.csv. This is a dataset related to how much money a person can get from a mortgage on his or her home. This dataset includes the following features:
* Gender: Gender of the borrower (including two values 'F' and 'M')
* Age: Age of the customer applying for a loan (including positive integer values)
* Income (USD): Customer's income in USD (value is a positive number)
* Income Stability: The level of customer's income stability (including three values of Low and High)
* Property Age: Life expectancy of the house in days (including positive integer values)
* Property Location: Location of the house (including 'Rural', 'Urban', and 'Semi-Urban')
* Property Price: The value of the house in USD (including positive real values)
* Loan Sanction Amount (USD): Amount that customers can borrow in USD (target value)
3. Steps:
    * Prepare and analyze data
    * Load dataset
    * Visualize some information of data
    * Preprocessing ( dropNaN, Feature Engineering)
    * Heatmap chart of data
    * Train linear regression model and show the model's intercepts, coeficients
    * Using Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet and compare the error of all 3 algorithms with Linear Regression (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
    *Try Polynomial of order 2 to compare the previous results.
